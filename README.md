# Jekyll-Terraform-Deployment
A simple Terraform script for deploying a Jekyll static site to AWS via S3 &amp; CloudFront.

Instructions for use:

-Install/Configure Terraform on your system & Clone the files into a local directory

-Change the values in the terraform.tfvars, Main.tf & CloudFront.tf files to represent your own deployment.

-Run "terraform apply" (If your feeling risky, but I'd recommend checking over it with 'terraform plan' first.)
